Yes, this literally just allows people to bypass the player limit for servers running a Spigot/Paper fork on version 1.13+.

## ⚒ Usage:
1. Download and install a permission manager plugin such as [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/).
2. Download and install the plugin's JAR file from the [releases tab](https://github.com/notgeri/JoinBypass/releases) into your server's `jar` folder.
3. Restart your server.
4. Give your desired players or groups permission to bypass the limit. With LuckPerms:
   - Player: `lp user YOURPLAYER permission set joinbypass.use`
   - Group: `lp group YOURGROUP permission set joinbypass.use`

## 🍀 Suggestions/Ideas:
It's meant to be the simplest plugin to achieve this but if there are any cool ideas you have that you think could help others, make sure to open an issue, and I'll happily look into it.
